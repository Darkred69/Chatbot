BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).

We also connect consumers with public transportation networks, e-bikes, e-scooters and other personal mobility options. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. We are also developing technologies that will provide autonomous driving vehicle solutions to consumers, networks of vertical take-off and landing vehicles and new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n\nOur technology is available in 69 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 9959, "end_char_idx": 12469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4c148ee-79af-42da-932e-d901c17772f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4c148ee-79af-42da-932e-d901c17772f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "c6d44ab16eed82118d584867b95569d62a94eabd548215643ca0cab716886582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cea42640-e0d0-4153-b952-6fe9095c6c87", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "d33248828b58eb3d2e7f8d024e350e7af3ccae7caa7a766723a26ad9608b1bf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eedb458d-d3af-4f3b-9975-f3714bd20c17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2efea362a1757265db19c00c7f40d4c0ecf559e36efb12f55fdf2277c9cfd49f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Rides Drivers and Delivery People are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s)\u201d.

We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Rides Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.

At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nEats\n\nOur Eats offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. We launched our Eats app over four years ago. We believe that Eats not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times. Eats also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Rides Drivers or who do not have access to Rides-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Eats provides Restaurants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Restaurants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses. In October 2019, we announced a majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13078, "end_char_idx": 15652, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f3e5342-70f3-4aa1-a530-a1ac4fd5d387": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f3e5342-70f3-4aa1-a530-a1ac4fd5d387", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "c6d44ab16eed82118d584867b95569d62a94eabd548215643ca0cab716886582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eedb458d-d3af-4f3b-9975-f3714bd20c17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "5564747ce1d72a8f63bf1b5304dd7f1caf5193f7d4cfc284d867b0533ee200d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4859546-45d5-4629-b186-20382c6fc87d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce55fc98ff76d18550751a8168e8fd8d9ad4edd7d134e0e7695b3ecf37ecf075", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "For example, Eats enables Rides Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Rides times.

The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

For example, the California Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 decision in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court, which established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status in the context of California wage orders, was expanded and codified in California via Assembly Bill 5, which was signed into law in September 2019 and became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities may, and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, a lawsuit filed in California (Colopy v.

Superior Court, which established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status in the context of California wage orders, was expanded and codified in California via Assembly Bill 5, which was signed into law in September 2019 and became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities may, and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, a lawsuit filed in California (Colopy v. Uber Technologies, Inc.) references Assembly Bill 5, and the plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction requesting the court to reclassify him and others similarly situated as employees. The preliminary injunction was denied, but the plaintiff also seeks a permanent injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers in California as employees or make other changes to our business model in California. Furthermore, a plaintiff in another jurisdiction has filed, and other parties may file, similar motions for injunctive relief and if we do not prevail, we may be required to make changes to our business model in such jurisdictions. In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We cannot predict whether Assembly Bill 5, or legislation in other jurisdictions, may lead to similar legislation being enacted elsewhere. Although we have filed a ballot initiative in California with other companies to address Assembly Bill 5, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts and the measure may not pass. Other examples of recent judicial decisions relating to Driver classification include the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the Employment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom that found that Drivers are workers (rather than self-employed) and a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 60280, "end_char_idx": 62833, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8f999ac-3668-4cfb-9dca-9cafea72b5ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8f999ac-3668-4cfb-9dca-9cafea72b5ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "c6d44ab16eed82118d584867b95569d62a94eabd548215643ca0cab716886582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ff6a893-4299-48ec-8c5f-986eab1e9a88", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "7f5212c8f6cf5d186736b877b351dc828afdf3523905f7418c7f4fd312e95fb9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4aa52a7d-2e8c-4d54-a5c3-8c54df13b67e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b61caa628b657d900e7564d4ad0f5aa03538ec8673364add0582f01cd21663d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We cannot predict whether Assembly Bill 5, or legislation in other jurisdictions, may lead to similar legislation being enacted elsewhere.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Rides Drivers in Australia.

The test is referred to as the \u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity. AB5 went into effect in January 2020.\n\nAB5 provides a mechanism for determining whether workers of a hiring entity are employees or independent contractors, but the new law does not result in any immediate change in how workers are classified. If the State of California, cities or municipalities, or workers disagree with how a hiring entity classifies workers, AB5 sets forth the test for evaluating their classification. A similar ABC test was adopted more than 10 years ago in Massachusetts.\n\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of AB5 on our business.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 304772, "end_char_idx": 306892, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "583f1484-0839-48c4-94dd-3f7b354e21f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "583f1484-0839-48c4-94dd-3f7b354e21f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "c6d44ab16eed82118d584867b95569d62a94eabd548215643ca0cab716886582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5470d5e-8e63-4e73-8ffb-ee6749e87b63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "b7b91bbb5ac3e6de8ca8be7b1d3bb8e1b76787e903b11acf009c4a929298c3fc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "008c3533-6287-4619-80b6-03a03ea384d1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7cb32399533810530af292ca0aab582f85798c9931ada63c266a37085e3f722", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.

The Company believes that these claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.\n\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to AB5, including how AB5 may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating condition, see the risk factor titled \u201c-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nTransport for London (\u201cTfL\u201d)\n\nTfL denied our application for a new license on November 25, 2019.

Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\n\nWe account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. However, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 427579, "end_char_idx": 430298, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5311fdf7-26d0-4da5-b46f-8d230ca21518": {"__data__": {"id_": "5311fdf7-26d0-4da5-b46f-8d230ca21518", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2019.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "c6d44ab16eed82118d584867b95569d62a94eabd548215643ca0cab716886582", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c310cd87-176a-41c4-b81e-81567b2f598c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2019"}, "hash": "525553c60fdde6d9ba2402d166b42d133ef691a36f5f0ad5e499d4910ba803ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95db9ad8-e1e9-48c1-a8c2-30dfed28fd71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "15158bc131d7b4017cd56c828117de622e1f131a0c25612b9e4be242e627c775", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above.
