Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.\n\nMobility\n\nOur Mobility offering connects consumers with a wide range of transportation modalities, such as ridesharing, carsharing, micromobility, rentals, public transit, taxis, and more\u2014helping customers go almost anywhere they need. We believe our global leadership position\u2014and the vast amount of marketplace data that comes along with it\u2014means that we have the best technical and data platform to innovate faster than other companies with similar products.\n\nWe believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover the best of local commerce\u2014from restaurants to grocery, alcohol, convenience and other retailers\u2014order a meal or other items, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have it delivered. We launched our Delivery app, Uber Eats, over seven years ago, and the business now includes the applications Postmates, Drizly and Cornershop across different markets. We believe our Delivery offering increases consumer engagement with the Uber platform overall, which in turn results in broader reach for our Merchants who can attract Uber Eats consumers from Uber without increasing their own costs.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 13211, "end_char_idx": 15791, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e5c4b13-0b7e-4e51-952a-98c27a177c7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e5c4b13-0b7e-4e51-952a-98c27a177c7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0a0af56a5c5c1308c3ecfb84a84b5159758b238107fdc5bac3ffb92692849bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e96fe2c-38ea-46c0-a11f-523e7c0abe7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "072dab41e8f9f63aff6ca76a642c93ee8b9d1d061ec2f22da8d7fc0dd0705303", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5930cc92-54cb-4efa-a992-3a37edb93fe5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c6dd776e08157381171876f1f5dc93b97f5763a6d22f4d09055cb461b13a8412", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We believe our scale and global availability allows our Mobility segment to offer better consumer experiences to riders in a variety of vehicle types, providing consumers with higher reliability and Drivers with better earnings opportunities.

For Drivers, we believe the Delivery offering leverages, and has expanded our earner base by increasing utilization and earnings across the network. We also believe it also attracts new Drivers to the platform who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles. Over the last several years our Delivery business has expanded to include Uber Direct, our white-label Delivery-as-a-Service offering to retailers and restaurants around the world, as well as advertising opportunities.\n\nFreight\n\nWe believe that Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry. Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries. Freight provides an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end while providing visibility and control of logistics networks. Freight connects Carriers with Shippers\u2019 shipments available on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button. Freight serves Shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises. By leveraging logistics solutions expertise and value-add solutions, Freight enables Shippers to create and tender shipments, secure capacity on demand with real-time pricing, and track those shipments from pickup to delivery. Freight operations are principally based in North America and Europe. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional transportation management and freight brokerage providers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 14710, "end_char_idx": 17499, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5930cc92-54cb-4efa-a992-3a37edb93fe5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5930cc92-54cb-4efa-a992-3a37edb93fe5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0a0af56a5c5c1308c3ecfb84a84b5159758b238107fdc5bac3ffb92692849bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e5c4b13-0b7e-4e51-952a-98c27a177c7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "db24948cbd5b19783b5113704aa5bc3d66b62c13c093415ae758923c1a531993", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bbcb1fe-209d-4355-95fe-8815b39aacf9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "505b4ce4c441b301b792d7bad8dd414ca61005e1d8255cb10fe049d85be84c76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Freight powers a managed transportation and logistics network and connects Shippers and Carriers in a digital marketplace to move shipments while leveraging our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries.

Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones. Operational Excellence Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.

We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n\nMobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and Riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n\nDelivery.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 21198, "end_char_idx": 23695, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bfd1c88-8bb3-49df-bd4d-63cc780ccb5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bfd1c88-8bb3-49df-bd4d-63cc780ccb5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0a0af56a5c5c1308c3ecfb84a84b5159758b238107fdc5bac3ffb92692849bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4761c92-4748-4571-9f5c-e8a774c62cea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0c2e6f1b8448fb48692b90397b164e09c96a830cdea61eabe09551b0ab0a242e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce15912c-8173-4d57-a9e5-f37a6d185c24", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58db11c3e8856c6e285cd569ae52b469a26c51b314d41aa9f30a7193991032cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n\nMobility.

A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\n\nIn the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products, including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules, and regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and regulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.

These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own vehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things, background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\n\nIn addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform.

The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and as a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

U.S. state, city, federal, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.\n\nPayments and Financial Services\n\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.

We historically conducted a semi-annual workforce survey that measures employee engagement, overall satisfaction, and well-being. But in 2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by collecting feedback from employees throughout the year and through various channels.

We encourage different opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work environment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement processes throughout Uber and measure progress.

To do that, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment.

Drivers are key parts of the marketplaces that Uber has created through its apps. A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with, traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available to anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At Uber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nAdvocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the\n\nsocial safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some recent examples of our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n\nIn Washington State, we welcomed a new law that preserves rideshare driver independence and confers new benefits such as minimum earnings guarantee, injury protection and paid sick leave.\n\nIn Chile, the legislature passed a law that incorporates platform workers into the government\u2019s healthcare and pensions scheme and introduces new requirements for platform companies such as minimum earnings guarantee for time spent actively working, maintain on-app insurance coverage, and provide couriers with safety equipment.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 44144, "end_char_idx": 46923, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfdda987-173b-40ff-b35c-ef5a514e7cca": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfdda987-173b-40ff-b35c-ef5a514e7cca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0a0af56a5c5c1308c3ecfb84a84b5159758b238107fdc5bac3ffb92692849bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "446a7c1a-7226-4647-b203-ab88d7e08f30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "d24b88930698862affc7a0f10c76a059072e5ffd46f721e0ebdc53cf83c24e2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f58639a0-98c0-40bf-b547-ebeb01827db3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2756236cbfbfde96c6a32819db2477c4cf04f968c1a6aebaa954290576da99e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The GDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special categories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated individual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and harming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance.

The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 275329, "end_char_idx": 277890, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "622a5458-c739-43b4-bccd-d0aa48e3f577": {"__data__": {"id_": "622a5458-c739-43b4-bccd-d0aa48e3f577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0a0af56a5c5c1308c3ecfb84a84b5159758b238107fdc5bac3ffb92692849bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7d7b08fe-6050-4e94-866f-800690d6bd27", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "04b293391a387de1feb21545fce313a1fb8a4271de60cfc63bf32da24c375969", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "df896e21-baaa-43b9-ad64-ae53c8f0c0f1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f70d0b762e59ed910d12071e8a8e0ce79f620dcf75e18d6a9c9ab6f79969368d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Australia Class Actions\n\nIn May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n140\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 403438, "end_char_idx": 405432, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bf19e4c-b607-4b58-baea-a2d072eeb46f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bf19e4c-b607-4b58-baea-a2d072eeb46f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2022.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "0a0af56a5c5c1308c3ecfb84a84b5159758b238107fdc5bac3ffb92692849bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff6934f6-a201-4d43-ae34-e40d7510519f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2022"}, "hash": "4af8e61bb2a8f350321814e79aed3307d27d838bac029067287d103c98b122e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "25a3a56a-7d9a-4546-aaa5-08ef01000225", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "91706cbaadc84ac94734d90f2959a26f279ff3ceb148dbc63731494941690ac3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
