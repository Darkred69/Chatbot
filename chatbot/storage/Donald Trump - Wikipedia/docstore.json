His father made him president of the family real estate business in 1971. Trump renamed it the Trump Organization and reoriented the company toward building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. After a series of business failures in the late 1990s, he launched side ventures, mostly licensing the Trump name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series The Apprentice. He and his businesses have been plaintiffs or defendants in more than 4,000 legal actions, including six business bankruptcies.\n\nTrump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote.[a] The Mueller special counsel investigation determined that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor Trump. During the campaign, his political positions were described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His election and policies sparked numerous protests. He was the only U.S. president without prior military or government experience. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged, racist, and misogynistic.\n\nAs president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations. He signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut taxes and eliminated the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials, used political pressure to interfere with testing efforts, and spread misinformation about unproven treatments. Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times but made no progress on denuclearization.\n\nTrump is the only U.S.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 7261, "end_char_idx": 9758, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04a62166-a8be-41af-b95f-efda9fb2fe58": {"__data__": {"id_": "04a62166-a8be-41af-b95f-efda9fb2fe58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Donald Trump - Wikipedia"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Donald Trump - Wikipedia.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Donald Trump - Wikipedia"}, "hash": "aed86ca99458f165285d34d71f8852707e666fbcff42effc25ead6f508ae6623", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56556227-2bcf-461a-8c64-013d603b9bcf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Donald Trump - Wikipedia"}, "hash": "92282ffdcff317faa5ed6cba30f48065d21c4a3b3e87de188961b5d0e69b42ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "57e75525-6101-46d3-a585-98986575445d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5c50097672f4e4ea99421a087b39357540c1edf904d9dba2b02842d7b0893840", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations.

The Senate acquitted him in both cases. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden but refused to concede. He falsely claimed widespread electoral fraud and attempted to overturn the results. On January 6, 2021, he urged his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol, which many of them attacked. Scholars and historians rank Trump as one of the worst presidents in American history.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has continued to dominate the Republican Party and is their nominee again in the 2024 presidential election.
