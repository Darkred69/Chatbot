Mobility also includes activity related to our Uber for Business (\u201cU4B\u201d), Financial Partnerships, Transit and Vehicle Solutions offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab, and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDuring 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Careem Inc.

We launched our Delivery app over five years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to deliver meals on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2020, we received regulatory approvals to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\"Cornershop\u201d\"), operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry today is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles, which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery.

We unsuccessfully appealed this injunction to the California Court of Appeal, which affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling and held that we must comply with the preliminary injunction order. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized as an electronic money institution in support of certain payment activities in the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 34334, "end_char_idx": 36982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14cd22bd-f5af-4413-b829-0ec16cf10499": {"__data__": {"id_": "14cd22bd-f5af-4413-b829-0ec16cf10499", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "hash": "fc970a6f6a8fb4f6b4f03bed663171f371af85b93e89f4b264d0ab5dfd6cf5bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06cf4116-a612-43f5-845c-5d5e0ec841c6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "hash": "7785fe5aaa4c86fe6ee335c9f463cfa57c0c55c01a6e5d7cc6979509b3d216c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "01c7ec9c-adc2-4b09-bdac-2bba20dee3bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1b0d4a4431070e3d168e43b20f2e8ecedf3d46de2129d0f0403b4be00b3550fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses.\n\nPayments and Financial Services\n\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.

In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform. We are continuing to evaluate our options for seeking further licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize payment solutions and support future growth of our business.\n\nAntitrust\n\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing competition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly surrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power.

In a 2020 global survey of Mobility Drivers, approximately 78% reported being satisfied with their experience driving with Uber.\n\nAccessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide geographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an app to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies from country to country, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally patchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification means that a worker is either an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few.

Around the world, Uber has found innovative ways to address these issues.\n\nProtections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, and recently started to implement additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22, as described in more detail below.\n\nEarnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest). In addition to tips, Drivers using Uber\u2019s platform have earned over $133 billion from the end of 2015 through the end of 2020.\n\nProgression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. In 2020, Drivers enrolled in over 3,200 courses in continuing professional education (entrepreneurship and English language learning) and over 2,300 undergraduate courses with Arizona State University online through our Uber Pro program.\n\nAdvocacy: We have also advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. In California, for example, we supported a state ballot initiative, Proposition 22, that California voters approved in November 2020 that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22:\n\nestablishes that app-based drivers are independent contractors and not employees;\n\nestablishes a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for drivers;\n\nprovides for occupational/accident insurance for injury protection;\n\nprovides a subsidy for healthcare expenditures of app-based drivers; and\n\nestablishes due process provisions and protection against discrimination and harassment for app-based drivers.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 47632, "end_char_idx": 50298, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84175655-d4dd-4e3a-b209-feaaf4003896": {"__data__": {"id_": "84175655-d4dd-4e3a-b209-feaaf4003896", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "hash": "fc970a6f6a8fb4f6b4f03bed663171f371af85b93e89f4b264d0ab5dfd6cf5bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e0af069-4e31-4dec-a034-22d6fde97639", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "hash": "78f523a582272622ba92bef53708b59fb2f4024a7316ad08a75819cac54e4d38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1bb3b44e-dc9b-403b-a5c1-f789459a3488", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "241e09921c8550dc13b6f8c0abd00fb610d6b81f26ce200260a911849e5a92b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Advocacy: We have also advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers.

Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.

Although we do not expect that the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction will go into effect, litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees, including the California Attorney General\u2019s suit, remains pending, and we may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.\n\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y. Aslam and Mr. J. Farrar, was brought in the UK Employment Tribunal against us asserting that they should be classified as \u201cworkers\u201d (a separate category between independent contractors and employees) in the UK rather than independent contractors. The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app was switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling.

Our policy for the presentation of these excess cumulative payments has changed from presenting them within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to presenting them as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 395677, "end_char_idx": 398508, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68d43c4d-4761-4dd2-b58a-6a47bfa0d5e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "68d43c4d-4761-4dd2-b58a-6a47bfa0d5e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2020.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "hash": "fc970a6f6a8fb4f6b4f03bed663171f371af85b93e89f4b264d0ab5dfd6cf5bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "341b4ebd-e7b5-41fa-87f7-4f89ef3c0198", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2020"}, "hash": "bcdf3e275c92dceb824e77f7a8d1ed29f0a66f0cbb29accb03131d0ca66545ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d35469b-a1cc-4805-94e6-432cfb1a76e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72d545d51ff3627ba1abd1ed355981e621e0e60f738e958b0e8fd92c632d9ea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.

Because we have limited means to collect our service fee for cash trips, and because we cannot control whether Drivers will generate future earnings that we can offset to collect our service fee, we have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service received. Driver incentives that are not for a distinct service are evaluated as variable consideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the Drivers at the time or as they are earned by the Drivers, depending on the type of Driver incentive.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we changed our accounting policy related to the presentation of cumulative payments to Drivers in excess of cumulative revenue from Drivers.

These referrals are typically paid in the form of a credit given to the referring end-user when earned. These referrals are offered to attract new end-users to our platform.

Accordingly, we record the cost of these promotions as a reduction of revenue at the time the trip is completed.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue and expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and / or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.

Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).
