Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\n\nWe believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing category position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of total ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a given region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly available information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we believed based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading ridesharing category position in its respective market.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 12668, "end_char_idx": 15229, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de8ccceb-977f-4285-a0b0-7e3ba37702ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "de8ccceb-977f-4285-a0b0-7e3ba37702ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2021.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "hash": "9aebdf0d3e78bbad0e3cb1cc27ff6b1149d4e310f1fdf0933bb59942c6e00a75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b100347f-88d2-42c5-90be-3ad6029c2a9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "hash": "d2c88f3c6bbce6592a98faacda9a95c71b850a8e36621344e7fd8dfdb85341a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b105918-a38b-490e-9d39-7c5bc0777767", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fcb948d01ea4c49d7e84e333fd0f3d476a10e47e694c6d6d1407496b91195f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world where we operate.

We launched our Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery enables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands the pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our platform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry is highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the process conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is equally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate and accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n\nWe serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks, secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent significant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n\nDuring 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 16064, "end_char_idx": 18582, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0b06bab-f71e-4b9b-bcb9-a3421cc9d85c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0b06bab-f71e-4b9b-bcb9-a3421cc9d85c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2021.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "hash": "9aebdf0d3e78bbad0e3cb1cc27ff6b1149d4e310f1fdf0933bb59942c6e00a75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b105918-a38b-490e-9d39-7c5bc0777767", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "hash": "a9e29256a7400b5b30d9ff007687a05bbc4099b77b9c4a93b8e9dc44bc200ce3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe76032d-29da-49fe-86f9-f2c93cb30677", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e12b3bbb5335ae03df0e5cc4e1b7509f48f9fc89dac928bf74be7afadb71196", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These inefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\nwhich are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.\n\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.

Together, these elements power movement from point A to point B.\n\nMassive Network Our massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip. In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people. Leading Technology We have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of our deep technology advantage and include demand prediction, matching and dispatching, and pricing technologies. Our technologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones. Operational Excellence Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators. Product Expertise Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.\n\nWe intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.\n\nWe believe that all of these synergies serve the customer experience, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users.

The California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit, the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

Regulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two examples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law which went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements for covered businesses. U.S. state, city, and foreign regulators are expected to continue proposing and adopting significant laws impacting the processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, such as the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) passed in California in November 2020 (effective in January 2023), and a draft data protection bill pending in India.\n\nPayments and Financial Services\n\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities.

Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees. As a result, we found that some employees were struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition.

To address some of these concerns, we strengthened our work-from-home policies and looked for new ways to support our employees as they navigated this crisis in their personal and professional lives.

To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging and are able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveys and related tools.

We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive. Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber through internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable them to have an impact on other areas of the business.

Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with the preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costs related to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs.

Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily for severance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.\n\nThese activities were designed to generate an aggregate cost savings of at least $1.0 billion annually when compared to our original fourth quarter 2020 planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\n64\n\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery.

We have concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery transactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and incentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n\nIn certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting against any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such, uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n\nDriver Incentives\n\nWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 416557, "end_char_idx": 418825, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c84f316-4e5a-43a4-89cc-f17eab75d509": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c84f316-4e5a-43a4-89cc-f17eab75d509", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UBER_2021.html", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "hash": "9aebdf0d3e78bbad0e3cb1cc27ff6b1149d4e310f1fdf0933bb59942c6e00a75", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b22557b-b14b-474a-afac-67a1e75753ed", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "UBER_2021"}, "hash": "6e57d0d61c578e523641f056e0228b935d8df4ec49ce1efc8dcfe0d2b8cb78d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33e7a1b3-fecd-4d9d-a7fe-df73d71fc59c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6be28ece5be4db86e5acc3d4288fd8222748a22e2fe67961b66a3ea18075acdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).
